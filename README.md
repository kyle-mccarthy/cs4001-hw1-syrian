# cs4001-hw1-syrian

- Explain the `with open(...) as collection:` construct in detail, then provide an example of code that uses it for the Syrian data CSV file.
- Explain the difference between a `list` and `dict` in python.  Provide code samples of each, where you fill them with at least three items then iterate through and print items out.
- Note the various styles of importing libraries and namespaces into Python.  Please list an example of each style that you find; along with an explanation of how these vary in terms of the importation of libraries.
- Explain an algorithm/steps to parse the Syrian CSV file and produce a simple HTML file that includes a table of the data. The table should have a header row using <th> elements then the data rows should have data in <td> elements. Implement this algorithm within the notebook and save the output as Data/SyrianIDP.html
- Explain an algorithm/steps to parse the file from step 4, Data/SyrianIDP.html, and convert it into a JSON file. Implement this algorithm within the notebook and save the output as Data/SyrianIDP_new.json
